    <p>Here are the combined statistics of <strong>tasks 4,5,6</strong>. Because the corpus is not that big, I've used only the age-groups and not the individuals. The plot shows only the lemmatized text, so there are many "unknowns" (Tree-Tagger default). Unknowns are mostly German words or rare proper names.

    Number of tokens in relation to age and task.

There are too many interesting things to drop eye on. A little collection:
<ul>
    <li>Youngest group has much more "unknowns"</li>
    <li>Youngest group tends to use diminutives "rybka","kolbaska"</li>
    <li>Youngest group uses much more the temp-adverb "potom"</li>
    <li>Middle group is at times really between the group frequencies</li>
    <li>The age groups have a gradually increasing number of tokens with the age (table above)</li>
    <ul>
        </p>
